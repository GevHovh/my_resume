## <b>Deep learning</b>

For the past 3 months, I have worked on several computer vision tasks and also had some experience with signal processing.

### DogsVsCats

I started with the "HelloWorld" of computer vision DogsVsCats classification. Some time after I returned to this task and applied transfer learning.

> DogsVsCats(Net).ipynb. - Network establishing and predictions.
> DogsVsCats(Vgg-19) - Fine-tuned vgg-19 for this classification task.

### Facial Expression Recognition

Then I moved to multi-label classification and found this dataset in Kaggle, with 28000 images(50x50 grayscale).

### Digital signal classification

I applied for a junior ml engineer job in some company and as a part of the selection process they sent me this assignment. For more details pls visit [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019).

> Net.ipynb. - Network establishing and predictions.

## <b>Old machine learning projects</b>

Pls note, that this notebooks were written several months ago and sinecne then my codding skills have improved significantly.

### Data science project's full pipeline

With this notebook I combined all techniques and methodes I learned in past 6 months(up to September 2020), since I have started to learn Data Science. Of course, most of what I studied is math, which I cann't show here, but I tried to implement that math in comments to the code.

## Big Five Personality Test, Exploratory analysis

Since I am recently interested in ['Big Five personality traits'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) theory, 
I was looking for dataset and I found one with 1.000.000 answers.<br>
This notebook is my playground, where I am trying to find interesting insights by myself.

## Movies dataset

With this dataset I wanted to get experience in data manipulation and Exploratory data analysis.<br>
You can find original data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).

> Movies ETL.ipynb - Data manipulation phase.<br>
> EDA_data.csv - Data ready for Exploratory analysis.<br>
> Movies EDA.ipnb - Exploratory data analysis.<br>

## Data visualization

Simple(or not) data visualizations without context.
