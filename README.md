## Data science project's full pipeline

With this notebook I combined all techniques and methodes I learned in past 6 months, since I have started to learn Data Science. Of course, most of what I studied is math, which I cann't show here, but I tried to implement that math in comments to the code.

## Big Five Personality Test, Exploratory analysis

Since I am recently interested in ['Big Five personality traits'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) theory, 
I was looking for dataset and I found one with 1.000.000 answers.<br>
This notebook is my playground, where I am trying to find interesting insights by myself.
